## Tuscan Stone Pizza Product Costing Database

## Proposal
This program will allow a local pizza business to gain a better understanding of their margins and product costs. This should optimize their ingredients ordering process.

## MVP
*	Store and return (CRUD) pizza recipes
*	Calculate COGS (cost of good sold)
*	Compare COGS across multiple stores


## Stretch Goals
*	Ideally the program will read csv files and maybe print updated csvâ€™s
*	A way for the program to generate ingredients order forms based off products sold/ingredients remaining
*	Sales Forecasting

## Database Schema UPDATED


## User Stories
* As a user, I should be able to find the ingredients required for every menu item
* As a user, I should be able to find the cost of goods sold for each menu item
* As a user, I should be able to rank each menu item by their margin
* As a user, I should be able to compare COGS across multiple stores
* As a user, I should be able to upload a sales report csv and have that info stored in a database

## Product Accounting Formula
Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory = Cost of Goods Sold

## Practice Reading and Storing CSV Data

Was able to successfully read and store csv data using the COPY command. Found a gem for using this in Rails applications.

## Program flexibility thoughts
Due to my comfort level with excel, as I work towards MVP, I'm going to prioritize reading a basic csv file. The file itself will consist of nothing more than the table columns I plan on storing it. So I will do considerable work in excel to find the needed info from sales/inventory reports, and then just have the program read simple tables.

## Excel Macro for order form generation
Sub CopyData()
'Updateby Extendoffice 20160922
    Dim xRow As Long
    Dim VInSertNum As Variant
    xRow = 1
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    Do While (Cells(xRow, "A") <> "")
        VInSertNum = Cells(xRow, "D")
        If ((VInSertNum > 1) And IsNumeric(VInSertNum)) Then
           Range(Cells(xRow, "A"), Cells(xRow, "D")).Copy
           Range(Cells(xRow + 1, "A"), Cells(xRow + VInSertNum - 1, "D")).Select
           Selection.Insert Shift:=xlDown
           xRow = xRow + VInSertNum - 1
        End If
        xRow = xRow + 1
    Loop
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
End Sub
